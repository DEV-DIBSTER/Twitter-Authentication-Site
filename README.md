# Twitter-Authentication-Site:
 Twitter Authentication Site. Used to authorize to automated accounts.

# Why open source?
 I was going to finish this project with decent CSS, but my app got suspended (assuming it was because I had an old API key, before Elon brought Twitter). Great project where I learned about authentication, and how to handle user data securely.
